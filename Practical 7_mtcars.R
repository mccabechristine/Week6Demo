# MTCARS Lab Practical 7 -----------------------------------------
# This practical session is based on the mtcars data which was 
# extracted from the 1974 Motor Trend US magazine and comprises 
# fuel consumption and 10 aspects of automobile design and performance 
# for 32 cars (1973--74 models). 
# The variables of the cars data frame are as follows: 
# mpg  Miles/(US) gallon 
# cyl  Number of cylinders 
# disp  Displacement (cu.in.) 
# hp  Gross horsepower 
# drat  Rear axle ratio 
# wt  Weight (1000 lbs) 
# qsec  1/4 mile time 
# vs  Engine (0 = V-shaped, 1 = straight) 
# am  Transmission (0 = automatic, 1 = manual) 
# gear  Number of forward gears  

# Question 1
# We would like to examine whether there is a link between the 
# weight of cars and their fuel efficiency as measured by MPG. 
# Devise a hypothesis test that we use for this analysis. 
# Describe the variables you will use for the analysis. 
# What type of variables are they? 
# Do they need to be converted? 
# If they do, convert them to the relevant data types in R.
